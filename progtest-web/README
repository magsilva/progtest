The easiest way to experiment ProgTest is to fire it up using:

	mvn jetty:run

This should execute Jetty and deploy ProgTest. The application will be
accessible at port 8080 on the current host (localhost), at the directory
'progtest'. Open a browser and try it out:

	http://localhost:8080/progtest/
